<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen you put together about a hundred of experienced, hard-core Software Engineers, the least you can expect is an overflow of awesomeness.</p>

So here we are, providing you with yet another technical blog to join the crowd of your feed reader. The technical tips updates from the trenches, by the fine Engineers at Sytac will populate this little republic of the digital world, hopefully providing some useful insights, practical tips and inspiring words to the technical community.

There is virtually no field in Computer Engineering which is not mastered by at least one of the members of our technical crew, so it's fair to expect quite a diverse set of topics in these pages. Stay tuned for quality content, we will make sure to keep you informed &amp; entertained!

If you care about getting better at coding, you may want to subscribe to our [feed]({{ '/feed' | prepend: site.baseurl}}). See you around!
